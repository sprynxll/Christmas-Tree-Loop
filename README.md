# Christmas-Tree-Loop
Practice from programming 1 of loops and arrays -> builds a Christmas tree using the user's choice of input. 

This program was built during Programming 1. The purpose was to use loops and arrays to allow the user to build a Christmas tree with whatever height they choose. The Christmas tree was programmed to be built out of '*' symbols and as the array loops, an astrix is added to the next line starting at 1. This is how the tree will change height with the user's input.

The program can be rerun until the user chooses to stop.

An example of what the program will output:
